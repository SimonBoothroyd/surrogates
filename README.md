This repository aims to provide a framework for automatically training surrogate models (mainly Gaussian Processes) 
against estimated condensed phase physical properties of molecular systems.

The goal is to employ these surrogate models as part of molecular force field optimisations involving more expensive
techniques such as [Bayesian MCMC](https://github.com/SimonBoothroyd/bayesiantesting).
